# Dhandho

It's a cli tool build in rust, that helps calculate intrinsic value of an investment.
The cli is inspired by the Mohnish Pabrai book "Dhandho Investor" which I still feel it's one of the best starting investing book.

cargo install dhandho
```

### dhandho cagr

> [CAGR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) Compounded anual growth rate.

###### Problem

You bought a Pokemn Trading card in 2012 at a price of 100\$. In 2022 your card is listed on ebay at a price of 350$.
Calculate the compounded anual growth rate.

###### Solution

Let's find out our input variables for this problem. We have the
_final value_ = 350.0\$
_initial value_ = 100.0\$
_investment period_ = 10 years (2022 - 2012);

```bash
dhandho cagr 350 100 10

0.1334616 # 13.34% 
```

The anual compounded growth rate for the investment is **13.34%**.

#### dhandho intrinsic

Intrinsic value is the value of an asset based on the cash flows it generates.

We have a company which has a market cap of 1000\$. The company has a cashflow growth rate of 10%. We will use a discount rate of 10% and a terminal multiple of 10x.

```bash
dhandho intrinsic -c 100 -g 10,0.10 -r 0.10 -m 10

year | fv         | pv        
------------------------------
0    | 0          | 100       
1    | 110        | 100       
2    | 121        | 100       
3    | 133.1      | 100       
4    | 146.41     | 99.99999  
5    | 161.05101  | 100       
6    | 177.15611  | 100       
7    | 194.87173  | 100       
8    | 214.35892  | 99.99999  
9    | 235.79482  | 99.99999  
10   | 259.3743   | 99.99999  
TV   | 2593.743   | 999.99994 
------------------------------
NPV               | 2000     

```

As we can see for the given requirements we have an intrinsic value of 2000\$. The company is undervalued.

#### dhandho kelly

Kelly criterion is a formula that helps you maximize your gains by providing different assumptions.

Let's say you have a 55% chance of winning 2x your investment and a 45% chance of losing 1x your investment.
The formula will help you calculate the optimal bet size.

```bash
dhandho kelly -a 0.55,2.0 -a 0.45,-1.0
0.32500002
```

The optimal bet size is 32.5% of your investment.
